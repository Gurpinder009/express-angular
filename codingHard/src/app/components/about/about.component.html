                <p>Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to
                    online content and prefer to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing
                    rooms.</p>
                <p>The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in 2006 and elated by the response it generated,
                    we worked our way to adding fresh tutorials to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of
                    tutorials and allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing to
                    academics and much more.</p>

                
                <p>Our content and resources are freely available and we prefer to keep it that way to encourage our
                    readers acquire as many skills as they would like to. We donâ€™t force our readers to sign up with us
                    or submit their details either. No preconditions and no impediments. Simply Easy Learning!</p>
                <h2 class="text-center">Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to deliver <b>Simply Easy Learning</b> with clear, crisp, and to-the-point content on
                    a wide range of technical and non-technical subjects without any preconditions and impediments.</p>
