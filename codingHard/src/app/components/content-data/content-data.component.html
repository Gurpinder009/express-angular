        <p>Angular 8 is a TypeScript based full-stack web framework for building web and mobile applications. One of the
            major advantage is that the Angular 8 support for web application that can fit in any screen resolution.
            Angular application is fully compatible for mobiles, tablets, laptops or desktops. Angular 8 has an
            excellent user interface library for web developers which contains reusable UI components.</p>

        <p>This functionality helps us to create Single Page Applications (SPA). SPA is reactive and fast application.
            For example, if you have a button in single page and click on the button then the action performs
            dynamically in the current page without loading the new page from the server. Angular 8 is Typescript based
            object oriented programming and support features for server side programming as well.</p>
